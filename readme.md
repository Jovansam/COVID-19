# A simple model that illustrates optimal economic lock-down

Coded in Julia, the model uses a SIR model with vital dynamics and a simple loss function from shutdown policy and deaths due to COVID to determine optimal policy.

The model is not yet calibrated to actual data, but illustrative parameters are used.

Install Julia, add JuMP, Ipopt, and Plots, then enjoy!
